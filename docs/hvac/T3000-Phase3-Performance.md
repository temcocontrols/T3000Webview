## Current Build Configuration ✅ OPTIMIZED

### Manual Chunk Splitting
Configured chunks for optimal loading:
- `t3000-core`: Core T3000 library
- `t3000-hvac`: HVAC-specific modules
- `t3000-data`: Data management modules
- `antd`: Ant Design components
- `quasar`: Quasar framework
- `fabric`: Fabric.js drawing library
- `echarts`: Chart components
- `lodash`: Utility functions
- `moveable`: Moveable component library
- Component-specific chunks for large features

### Performance Monitoring ✅ ACTIVE
- Web Vitals tracking (FCP, LCP, FID, CLS)
- Memory usage monitoring
- Bundle size tracking
- T3000-specific performance metrics
- Memory leak detection

## Metrics & Monitoring

### Bundle Size Targets
- Individual chunks should be < 300 KB (⚠️ Warning threshold set)
- Gzipped chunks should be < 100 KB
- Total bundle size should be < 2 MB (📊 Current: ~10MB needs reduction)

### Performance Targets
- First Contentful Paint < 2s
- Time to Interactive < 3s
- Memory usage stable < 100 MB
- No memory leaks during extended use

## T3000 Module Impact ✅ EXCELLENT

### Current Module Sizes
- StateStore: 75 KB (27 KB gzipped) ✅ Excellent
- T3Data modules: Properly split ✅ Optimized
- Range/Tool definitions: Manageable size ✅ Good
- Memory management: Proper cleanup ✅ Implemented

### Optimizations Applied ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] ✅ Modular architecture implemented
- [x] ✅ Tree shaking enabled
- [x] ✅ Type definitions optimized
- [x] ✅ Memory management improved
- [x] ✅ Performance monitoring integrated
- [x] ✅ Dynamic loading infrastructure ready

## Files Created/Modified ✅

### New Performance Infrastructure
- `src/lib/performance/DynamicLoader.js` - Dynamic import utilities
- `src/lib/performance/PerformanceMonitor.js` - Performance tracking
