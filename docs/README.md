### Phase 4: Runtime Error Resolution (Continued - July 2025) ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

#### 4. **Async Component Timeout Resolution**
**Root Cause**: Large JavaScript chunks (like pathseg.js at 61KB taking 1719ms) were causing async component timeouts after 15 seconds, leading to application failures.

**Fixes Applied**:
- **Enhanced Router Configuration**: Updated routes.js with intelligent timeout management
  - Component-specific timeouts: IndexPage2/HvacIndexPage2 (30s), SVGEditor (25s), MainLayout (20s)
  - Intelligent retry logic with exponential backoff (3 retries with increasing delays)
  - Promise race implementation to prevent hanging imports
- **ChunkLoadingManager**: Created specialized chunk loading error handler
  - Global chunk error monitoring for script loading failures
  - Known problematic chunks configuration (pathseg.js: 25s timeout, 5 retries)
  - Automatic retry with progressive delays for failed chunks
  - Webpack cache clearing for failed chunks
- **AsyncComponentTimeoutManager Enhancements**: Improved timeout handling
  - Component-specific timeout mappings for heavy components
  - Performance monitoring for chunk loading with detailed metrics
  - Enhanced error reporting with chunk size and load time tracking
- **Boot Integration**: Added early initialization in performance.ts
  - Chunk loading manager initialized before other systems
  - Performance monitoring enabled for development and production
  - Integration with existing error handling infrastructure

**Technical Improvements**:
- **Smart Timeout Calculation**: Dynamic timeouts based on component complexity and known performance characteristics
- **Retry Strategy**: Exponential backoff with maximum retry limits to prevent infinite loops
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of chunk loading performance with detailed metrics
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful fallback to error components when loading fails completely
- **Cache Management**: Intelligent clearing of failed module caches to enable fresh retry attempts

**Benefits**:
- **Eliminated timeout errors**: No more 15-second async component failures
- **Improved load reliability**: Automatic retry for slow network conditions
- **Better user experience**: Loading indicators and error boundaries prevent blank pages
- **Performance insights**: Detailed monitoring of chunk loading performance
- **Graceful degradation**: Proper error handling when components fail to load

**Monitoring & Debugging**:
- Console logging for chunk loading progress and failures
- Performance metrics showing chunk size and load times
- Retry attempt tracking and failure analysis
- Integration with existing error handling infrastructure
