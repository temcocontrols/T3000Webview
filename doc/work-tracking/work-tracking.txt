1. add a top toolbar, move options and functions from 'Edit' & 'Object' menu
2. add 'Weld Selected' option to 'Edit' menu, top tool bar and context menu

2024-10-22
1. implement the 'Weld Selected' logic

2024-10-23
1. try to use clipper.js and paper.js to do Boolean operations on SVG files.
2. add some examples
3. fix bugs for 'Weld Selected' tool, trying to use third part libary to do the boolean operations for selected items.

2024-10-24
1. continue to implement the weld function,
2. rewrite the merge logic with paperjs, add a new demo to do boolean operations for some sample shapes

2024-10-25
1. implement the weld tool function, try to weld some complex shapes.

2024-10-26/2024-10-27 (4 hours total)
1. fix bugs and make some improvements for resizing and repositioning

2024-10-28
1. fix bugs: when page reloads, can not save the objects status
2. start to implement new functions to welded object

2024-10-29
1. continue to implement new functions
2. small fix for resizing welded objects

2024-10-30
1. continue working on the new functions
2. try to add a new vue component for canvas drawing, integrate it into vue-moveable and vue-selecto,
the existing components (moveable,selecto) may not suitable for transfering the shapes into lines and points.

2024-10-31
1. working on the new function, try to use another library to implement the logic
2. merge 'top toolbar','weld selected' code to main branch for releasing new version

2024-11-01
1. trying to use a different way to deal with the shapes,
use paperjs to redraw the shapes as lines and points, make them controlable.

2024-11-03 (4h)
1. add a child canvas layer for vue-moveable & vue-selecto selected items, perform lines and points extraction, redraw the shape with them.

2024-11-04
1. use canvas as the inner layer to replace the origin one for selected items,
extract the lines and points and reshape them into a new item, make lines and points movable and resizable.

2. add new category "General" with some basic shapes to left side bar.
the origin duct was combined with 2 svgs and divs, not easy to extract the lines and points, so currently i use rectangle instead.

3. i also add a new IndexPage page to perform some checking for the new library, to see if it is possible to replace
vue-movable and vue-selecto in further development.

4. completed the most part of the function, but found some issues when resizing and rotating the outer div.
i will continue to do more tests and fix them.

2024-11-05
1. fixed some small bugs
2. applied the new logic to ducts, make the new shape's lines and points can be modified after welding.
3. i will continue to implement more functions for the welded item, like rotating, reloading, resizing.

2024-11-06 (OT 2)
1. do more test for the new functions, and fix some bugs.
2. add new logic to handle the rotating event for the weld item after resizing and repositioning.

2024-11-07

2. learn how to draw a wall in revit way, compare it to alaa's code

2024-11-08
